Soils are complex systems that offer irreplaceable services and benefits to human societies. Soil systems contain many components including mineral particles, water, air, and organisms that constantly interact with each other. I am interested in understanding how these interactions regulate the resilience and vulnerability of soils in response to disturbances such as tillage and rising temperature. I am studying how to integrate the rapidly increasing amount of soil data to aid land management and fight climate change. My past research touched on topics including soil carbon persistence and decomposition, coupled soil carbon-nutrient cycling, soil mapping, and biogeochemical implications of climate change and land use.
